# Drum Kit 

![Drum Kit v1 Preview](./thumbnail.png)

## Description
The Drum Kit project is a fully interactive web application that showcases a custom-drawn drum kit in Figma, serving as the centerpiece of the website. The drum kit is created entirely using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), and different sections of the kit are grouped together using the g element. The project also utilizes the text element inside SVG to insert text representing different keyboard keys.
